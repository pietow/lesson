# Standard way to create Express Server

### 1. In Project directory, open Terminal and hit this command:

``` npm init ```

> This will ask some quistions about the project, like package name, version, description ...<br>At the end, type yes to confirm.<br>A new file will be created which is ``` pakage.json ``` that will contains all information we entered.

Short way also to start an express is to type in terminal:

``` npm init -y ```

> This will automaticly create ``` package.json ``` file with standard values, like the package name will be the folder name, version will be 1.0.0, and no description, and if there is a git repository on the folder will be added, and the entro file will be ``` index.js ```.
