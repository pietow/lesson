// "this"
// "this" is a keyword, not a variable, so you cannot assign "this" a value with an 
// assignment statement

// the value of "this" depends on the context of use
// when used in the global scope, the value of "this" is the global object
console.log(this);

// when used in a function, the value of "this" is the invocation context
// what the invocation context is, depends on the way the function is called
// there are 4 ways in which a function can be called
// 1. as a function
// 2. as a method
// 3. as a constructor function with the "new" keyword
// 4. with "call" or "apply"

// 1. as a function
// in non-strict mode, the invocation context is the global object
function wrapper() {
    "use strict"; // "this" undefined
    console.log(this);
}
wrapper(); // window (in the browser)

// 2. as a method 

// when a regular function is called as a method of an object, the value of "this" is the object
let user = {
    age: 43,
    getAge: function() {
        return this.age;
    }
};
console.log(user.getAge()); // the value of "this" is the object on the left side of the dot

// when an arrow function is called as a method on an object, the value of "this" is the value of "this"
// in the lexical scope in which the function is defined.

// what is the value of "this" in the lexical scope in which the function is defined?
user = {
    thisValue: this,
    age: 43,
    getAge: function() {
        return this.age;
    }
}
console.log('The value of "this" in user is ' + user.thisValue);

var age = 20;
user = {
    age: 43,
    getAge: () => this.age
}
console.log(user.getAge()); // since "this" is the global object, and since the global object does not have 
// an age property, we get undefined as return value

// But inner functions don't inherit the "this" value of outer functions
user = {
    name: 'Jim',
    getName: function() {
        let that = this; // self
        console.log(this.name);
        function inner() {
            return that.name;
        }
        return inner();
    }
}
console.log(user.getName()); // undefined

// How can we fix this?
user = {
    name: 'Jim',
    getName: function() {
        const inner = () => this.name;
        return inner();
    }
}
console.log(user.getName()); // if the inner function is an arrow function, the value of "this"
// is the value of this in the lexical scope; here
// the lexical scope is the function scope of the outer function
// in the scope of the outer function "this" refers to user
// and so this.name is user.name, which is 'Jim'.

// 3. as a constructor function with the "new" keyword
function User(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}
const jim = new User('Jim', 43); // the value of "this" in the User function is the newly created object
console.log(jim.age); 
console.log(jim);
jim.address = '1600 Pennsylvania Ave.';

// 4. indirectly, with "call" or "apply"
const getName = function() {
    return this.name;
}
console.log(getName.call(jim));
console.log(jim.name);
console.log(getName.call(jim) === jim.name);
