        - birth date

    - create database on mongodb atlas called FBW-e05-1
    - save user registered data in a collection called users in the database
    - create a schema called userSchema with these properties and validation:
        - first name: string, min length: 2 , max length: 50, required
        - last name: string, min length: 2 , max length: 50, required

    - sending registered user data from front to back end should be by FETCH 

#### Extra:
on the database validation : 

    - email: should be an email format
    - birth date: user should be 18 years old or older

#### Task2:
after register done:
    - show a message on front-end with errors or success message , you need to use bootstrap modals or Alerts for that
    - send email to the user with this link 'http://localhost:5500/verifiy/:userid'
    - if user click that link the system should find the user with the same id that comes from url parameter :id and set verify property in database to be true instead of false.
